            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <img src="Drone-irrigation.webp" alt="Drone-irrigation">
            <p> Using microwave sensing, drones are able to capture very accurate soil health information including moisture levels without the plants getting in the way. </p>
            
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <P>Drone irrigation involves using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to monitor and manage water distribution for crops. Equipped with advanced sensors and imaging technology, drones can assess soil moisture levels, identify areas needing irrigation, and sometimes even deliver water directly to plants.</P>

            <h2>Uses</h2>
            <p>Soil Moisture Monitoring: Drones equipped with multispectral and thermal sensors can measure soil moisture levels to optimize irrigation schedules.
                Irrigation Mapping: Creating detailed maps of fields to identify water distribution needs and variations across different zones.
                Precision Irrigation: Applying water only where necessary, reducing waste and ensuring crops receive adequate hydration.
                Data Collection: Gathering data for better irrigation management, including weather patterns and plant health.</p>

            <h2>Benefits</h2>
            <p>Water Conservation: More efficient water use reduces overall consumption and prevents over-irrigation.
                Cost Savings: Minimizing water usage leads to lower utility costs and can reduce labor for manual irrigation.
                Enhanced Crop Health: Ensuring crops receive the right amount of water promotes better growth and yields.
                Increased Efficiency: Drones can quickly cover large areas, allowing for timely interventions.
                Adaptability: Drones can easily adjust to changing weather conditions and crop needs..</p>
            
            <h2>Investment</h2>
            <p>Initial Costs: A drone setup for irrigation monitoring can range from ₹2 lakhs to ₹10 lakhs, depending on features and technology.
                Training Costs: Training farmers or operators may cost between ₹30,000 to ₹70,000.
                Maintenance: Ongoing maintenance can be around ₹15,000 to ₹30,000 annually.</p>

            <h2>Returns and Savings</h2>
            <p>Water Savings: Efficient irrigation can reduce water usage by 20-50%, translating to significant cost savings.
                Yield Improvement: Better water management can enhance crop yields by 10-15%.
                ROI: With effective implementation, farmers can expect to see returns within 1-2 years, especially in water-scarce regions.</p>
